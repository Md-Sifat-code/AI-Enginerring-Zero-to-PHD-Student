# **AI Engineering: Zero to PhD Student**

## **About This Project**

Welcome to my AI Engineering journey! This project is a day-by-day log of my progress as I move from an absolute beginner in Artificial Intelligence to advanced, PhD-level understanding. The goal is to gain both theoretical knowledge and hands-on experience, preparing for a future in AI engineering, research, and innovation.

## **Learning Approach**

I am following a structured path:

1. **MIT 6.036 - Introduction to Machine Learning**:
   I am using the MIT 6.036 course for a solid theoretical foundation in machine learning. This course dives into the math, algorithms, and key concepts of AI, including supervised and unsupervised learning, linear regression, and neural networks.

2. **Vizuara YouTube Channel - AI Project Setup**:
   Alongside my theory studies, I’m learning how to build real-world AI projects using the Vizuara YouTube channel. This channel provides detailed tutorials on setting up AI systems, working with popular libraries like TensorFlow and PyTorch, and creating impactful AI-driven projects.

## **What I’m Working On**

- **Theory**:
  Following the MIT course structure, I am focusing on understanding the mathematical and computational foundations of machine learning and AI. Topics covered include:

  - Supervised and Unsupervised Learning
  - Neural Networks and Deep Learning
  - Probabilistic Models
  - Optimization Techniques

- **Projects**:
  Simultaneously, I am working through various AI projects, including:

  - Data Preprocessing
  - Building ML models for classification, regression, and clustering
  - Implementing neural networks and training them on real datasets
  - Experimenting with AI deployment and real-time data analysis

## **My Goal**

By the end of this journey, I aim to have a strong theoretical understanding of AI, as well as a portfolio of projects demonstrating my hands-on skills. This is a step-by-step guide towards becoming an AI engineer or researcher at the PhD level.
